Twitter Bot Utils
==================

The goal of Twitter Bot Utils is to ease the creation of
creating Twitter bots by abstracting away the repetition involved in
dealing with keys.

Twitter bot utils is somewhat opinionated: it assumes that you want to
create command line tools, and that you can store your keys in a basic text
configuration files. See :doc:`./helloworld` for a basic run-through.

Some additional documentation is in the `readme <https://github.com/fitnr/twitter_bot_utils/blob/master/README.md>`__.

This package is intended to assist with the creation of bots for artistic
or personal projects. Don't use it to spam or harrass people.
